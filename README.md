# ElevatorSystem
A simple yet powerful simulation of an elevator system designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming, system design principles, and real-world logic. This project models elevator operations such as floor requests, movement logic, and state management.

# Features
Handles multiple floor requests efficiently.
Simulates elevator movement and direction logic.
Supports extensible design for:
 * Multiple elevators
 * Priority handling
 * Emergency stop logic
